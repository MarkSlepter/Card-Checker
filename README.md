# Task 1
There is a client.
The client can have any number of cards.
The card has three fields - cvv-code, card number and amount on the card.
Display a message about how many identical cards the client has.
The field describing the amount on the card should not participate in the comparison.
That is, two cards with the same cvv codes and numbers but different amounts are considered identical.
Provide for different variants of the output message - for example, the client does not have any cards, the client does not have the same cards and other possible situations.
